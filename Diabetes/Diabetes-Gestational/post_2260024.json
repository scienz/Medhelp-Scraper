      "POST_BODY": "Hey ladies! Here is some interesting info on the gestational diabetes test. I personally will be saying no to this test and I hope u all will at least do some research and make an informed decision for you and your sweet baby :) at the bottom I've included websites where I got all of this info. Here are some facts I found: \r\rGlucola test has a sensitivity of 76%. This means that a positive result will correctly identify about 76 out of 100 women who have gestational diabetes (the other 24 would go un-identified and not realize they have gestational diabetes). The specificity of the test is 76%. This means that among 100 women without gestational diabetes, 76 will have a negative result (and 24 women who do not have gestational diabetes will have a positive result!)\r\rThe glucose drink contains BVO or, brominated vegetable oil which is contained in many sodas and prevents the flavor from rising to the top of the drink. \r\rBVO is patented in the US as a flame retardant and is actually banned from soft drinks in Europe and Japan. \r\rResearch has shown that these substances build up in the body as well as breast milk and leave residues that accumulate in the brain, liver and other organs. \r\rBVO has been associated with heart lesions, fatty changes in the liver and impaired growth and developmental development and both animal and human studies have linked BVO to fertility problems, neurological problems and changes in thyroid hormones. \r \r\"In a study with 25,000 women, stillbirth and infant death are such rare occurrences that this study did not have a big enough sample size to look at deaths. However, the authors reported that they did not find any association between infant deaths and gestational diabetes \"(Metzger, Lowe et al. 2008).\r\rThe following statements were included in an ACOG article...\r\r\u201cThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has concluded that although there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening, screening high-risk women may be beneficial.\u201d\r\r\u201cThe 50-g, 1-hour laboratory screening test has become widely used\u2026despite the absence of data to demonstrate a benefit to the population as a whole.\u201d\r\r\u201cIt should be emphasized that although the evidence is inconclusive that treating gestational diabetes can prevent maternal and fetal complications, universal screening and treatment are widely practiced.\u201d\r\rThat is just SOME of what I've found. I hope all you moms can take the time to do some research and make an informed decision! \r\rHere are some website where I got this info: \r\rhttp://evidencebasedbirth.com/gestational-diabetes-and-the-glucola-test/\r\rhttp://foodbabe.com/2014/05/13/shocking-why-are-doctors-recommending-this-toxic-drink/\r\rhttp://avivaromm.com/dont-drink-glucola-gestational-diabetes"
