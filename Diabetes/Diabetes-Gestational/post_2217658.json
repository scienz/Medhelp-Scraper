So I was wondering if anyone here is going through the same thing and can offer some good advice or thoughts. This is my 3rd child and never had this with either of my other two children. I don't meet with the diabetes educator until next week so I've been trying to educate myself beforehand. Please help I'm getting anxiety about it!!\r\rThank you!"

I was severely diabetic with my daughter and my best advice is watch your carbs. 15 for breakfast, 15 for 3 snacks, 30 for lunch, & 45 for dinner. I can't believe I remember those numbers after 10 yrs but I drilled it in my head and payed close attention and she had no complications from it. I did also end up having to take insulin, but again, even if it comes to that it just means a little more work for your lil one. Don't let it scare you. :)"
