      "POST_BODY": "I am trying to stay positive but tomorrow I will be 8wks & 3 days which was when my little angel's heart was estimated to have stopped. I am very worried, I have a dating scan at 9 weeks but I really wanted to get one earlier to give myself some peace but no one had any available spots. My missed miscarriage was a terrible ordeal, I went in to have medical management; the medication and the next day I woke up in labor and hemorrhaged. I ended up passing the baby at home but was rushed into surgery when they found tissue still inside the uterus. \rThis happened on the 26th of February and this pregnancy seems to be going well apart from my symptoms starting to disappear at times. I just really am so frightened about losing this baby, my partner is being supportive but that fear ofggoing for a scan and seeing no heartbeat is very much alive. \rAnyone else been through this? How did you cope?"

This pregnancy was very different from the last as I have symptoms I didn't last time. I have been worried sick up until this week and haven't been able to enjoy my pregnancy. My only advice it to take it by day and week and take care of yourself. Make sure your vitamins included iron. That is a mistake I made the first time and became anemic."

This time we decided to noy have the stress and wait to get a test done if I started showing signs. We waited and I found out at 9 weeks that was in march im now 25 wks and 6 days. Hes doing amazing and we couldnt be happier. Just try and relax dont let the stress get to you. I know its hard to not think about the first time. I was worried this time again when I got pregnant since it was so close to my last miscarriage. But I hope everything goes well for this baby god is with you just stay calm and think about seeing your lil baby in a couple days at the 9 wk scan"
