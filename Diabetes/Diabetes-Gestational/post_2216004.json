As long as you maintain a healthy diet and exercise you can regulate your sugar levels and you and your baby will be fine. Yes, still born babies are a rare risk but that is when you let your glucose levels sky rocket and don't take care of yourself. Low carbs, no more sugary snacks and 30 minutes of exercise a day. They will also have you take your glucose levels several times a day. Not being able to eat everything in sight ***** when your pregnant but it's worth it for the baby. And a good part is you get weekly ultrasounds to check on your baby so I get to see my baby girl ever week."

I was very determined and followed the diet. After a week I noticed it's not that hard and my numbers have been perfect. I don't need medication or insulin. Plus, my baby is measuring right where she should be. The one thing I can say is that it is NOT your fault and you did nothing to bring this on. Sometimes our hormones work against us and we need extra help to ensure a healthy mommy and baby. Some women can diet control and some need more interventions to help them along. It's not as bad as people make it seem. If you need any help please let me know!"
