I found out I was pregnant at 6 weeks and before pregnancy I'd cheat all the time. But even till this day I'm still starving. Lol. I can't wait my 2 and half hours for my next snack or meal lol. It's all about porportions. One thing that helped was my doctor said it's okay to go over on protein and veggies. Just stick within range of the carbs since that's what spikes your sugar more. So I added a salad to every lunch and dinner just cuz I feel I need to eat more. Plus the additional veggies on my plate. And usually try to stick to lean meats. I serve a portion and a half. Sometimes 2. My weight has stayed stable and my sugars have been great. Oh and lots of water! I know it's so hard but it's something we just have to do. I hope the time Flys for you :)"
