I've had to start on non stress tests at every appointment and have to get extra ultrasounds to check and make sure my placenta is still functioning efficiently. My midwife told me today they might not be able to let me wait until labor starts naturally if I go overdue, that induction might be necessary. She told me I have an increased risk of having a \"sudden stillborn\" birth from the diabetes. Also that in some cases if the placenta stops functioning properly and baby isn't delivered soon enough that brain damage can result from a lack of oxygen. Lung development may be delayed. \nThere are lots of potential complications. Many women don't end up having trouble but it really is a serious diagnosis and requires close monitoring. Even just having a \"big baby\" carries risks of its own. \nI'm not trying to scare you. But it's not as easy as just \"follow orders\" and \"be sensible\". Even women who strictly adhere to diet and medication orders can end up with complications. It's less likely obviously if it's well controlled. But it doesn't just happen to noncompliant patients. It's just one of those things that you do the best you can, and hope for the best. The chances of a healthy baby are still really good. Catching it early and starting treatment right away is key. \nGood luck."
