As long as you control it with diet you should be fine I have had no issues controlling it just follow what they say and you will be OK. Your key here is to eat lots of green veggies and lots of protein, protein cancels out most carbs so stick to high protein low carbs little to no sugar and you will be good. Also take short walks after eating and drink lots of water. Good luck"
