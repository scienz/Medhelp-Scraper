      "POST_BODY": "i am 37 weeks pregnant. I have gestational diabetes. I do not take meds and insulin because my sugar has always been in control throughout whole pregnancy but since ive started my ninth month it has been getting veryy difficult to control. I eat very less avoiding potatoes rice and all high cArb food. I was wondering does eating less would affect my bAbys weight? Does anyone have gestational diabetes ? How do you control it without effecting bAbys weight? My baby weighs 2.7 kilograms."

Sometimes Im not hungry when its my snack time but I have to remind myself that its nutrients the baby needs including carbs. One thing that helps keep my sugars under control is going for a 15 min walk after I eat. Goodluck were almost there :)"
