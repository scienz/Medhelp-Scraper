      "POST_BODY": "I am 32 weks pregnant and have just been diagnosed as having gestational diabetes. I am having a difficult time understanding why I have this. I am 29 years old, this is my 3rd pregnancy and I did not develop this condition with the first 2 pregnancies. I was, however in my early twenties with the first 2. Before pregnancy I was at a very healthy weight at 135 and I am 5' 7\" and I worked out 3-4 times a week. Since becoming pregnant I am only at the gym 1-2 times a week. I have gained almost 40 pounds with this pregnancy and still have 8 weeks to go.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know why i.have gained so much this time around. Anyways, I can't help but feel I have done something to put myself and my baby at risk for future health problems. I have done a lot of research regarding the condition but am interested to hear other thoughts, opinions, and experiences. Thanks!"

I find out in the next week or so if i have it again, but i'd say with my previous history no doubt i will. I am only a small person too, 95 lbs and i kept fit with my last pregnancy, even the doctors were baffled as to why i got it. you are usually a higher risk for it if you are overweight, already suffer diabetes, or are over 35. I've even been tested for it after pregnancy to see if i was suffering from it already. I'd like to know too why i got it when i didn't even have any risk factors! But don't stress yourself about it, i highly doubt its something you've done."

(i have family with diabetes and i am over weight) \rmy aunt had gd with her first but never with her other two children. her son was born very big but she herself was always thin and does not have diabetes later on in life. sometimes its just the way your body works at that point in your life.\ri realize a good wallow is helpful sometimes but after you're done being upset i hope you can find a way to come to peace with gd and deal with it.\rthe counselling is just teaching you how to eat to maintain a steady blood sugar level so you don't get dizzy or have problems for your last few weeks of pregnancy. its only a few weeks of diet change and then you'll be back to normal. its not something that is worth being angry about but just doing for the health of you and your child. you may actually find that the diet makes you eat MORE!! i remember wanting to stop eating so much!! you eat every 2 or so hours and you get so tired of eating! you can also still have treats. i made it so that i would get 2 pieces of chocolate for a snack (especially cause i was tired of eating and 2 pieces of chocolate was like a break)\u00a0\u00a0another benefit was my heart burn issue nearly went away completely!\ranyway, please don't blame yourselves or anyone, but just face the challenge as an adventure and a time to learn about what diabetics go through every day. see it as a learning experience and as a way of you taking care of the health of your little one.\rits really not so bad and not worth being upset over when you just have to change your diet a little bit.\rfood journals now will help you step into the diet easier when you do get the diet plan.\rgood luck ladies"
