      "POST_BODY": "Hi everyone,\n\nI just went to the doctor today (I'm 29 weeks 3 days). I failed my 1 hour and also borderline failed my 3 hour. My doctor said according to the two references of ranges- one says I'm fine and one reference says I have GD. To be safe she asked me to monitor my blood sugar levels for 2 weeks.\n\nShe measured my belly today and also said in measuring small- only 26-27 weeks. She ordered an ultrasound to check development and fluid. \n\nDo these things have anything to do with each other? I'm kind of freaking out about her being so small. Everyone always comments on how small my belly is"
