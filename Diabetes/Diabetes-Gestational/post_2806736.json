It is just being mindful of what I'm eating and honestly I'm thankful I was found to have gestational diabetes because I now can't/won't use the excuse \"it's for the baby\" when I just wanted something extra. For meals I keep my carbs at 45 per meal 3 meals a day and 15 carbs per snack 2-3 snacks a day. Plus anything that does not have carbs ex eggs, chicken ect I can eat to my hearts content also by knowing I have gestational diabetes I drink a lot of water so I'm never worried about not drinking enough because I'm drinking all day. Side note I'm 39 weeks and 2 days :)"

It's not that bad some people complain because they feel starved but there are things you can eat that have no carbs in them. In my personal opinion when women feel starved is because they want to eat things that are high in carbs so they could only have a little or they won't eat certain things where they can have more. It really is all about perspective. I'd chose a nice chicken and salad over let's say pasta and then on top of it soda is loaded with carbs so the tiny bottles of it would be more then an entire snack"
