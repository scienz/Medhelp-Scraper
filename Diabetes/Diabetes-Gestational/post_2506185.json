For example, when I am high, I know that 1 unit of insulin will bring my blood sugar down by 10 points.\u00a0\u00a0Then if I am 150 at 3 hours after eating, I will correct.\n\nYour basal insulin (the levemir) will also need to be increased as the pregnancy progresses.\n\nPlease ask your doctor about all of the points raised here.\n\nAlso, you may find that exercise (walking or other exercise for 30 minutes) after eating, helps to bring down your sugars as well.\n\nHope it helps.\u00a0\u00a0The efforts will be worth it.\n\nIt is possible to control blood sugar to the degree they want, but only if you understand how to use insulin to it's full advantage.\n\nYou can get the following books which may help, as they describe how to use and adjust insulin doses:-\n\nThink Like a Pancreas\nUsing INsulin - John Walsh\nDiabetes Solutions - Dr. Bernstein\n\nHopefully your dr. can refer you to a diabetes educator who can teach you further how to adjust and use insulin."
