I've been calling them and pushing them and all they say is they'll call back. My question is can any of you give me tips on more less what I can eat, what to stay away from and so?"

Carbs turn into sugar in the body so you want to limit your intake. One thing I did was when I made spaghetti I used spaghetti squash-- it was really good.
