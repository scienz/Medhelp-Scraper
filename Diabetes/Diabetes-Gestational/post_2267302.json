More often than not before I got pregnant mine was over 12... my last one after I found out I was pregnant back in May I think was 6.8 I was ecstatic. But just watch what you eat and how much. I'm sure they've told you about what you can and can't eat as much. But be glad that gd. Does go away after baby comes. So don't freak yourself out. Just do what's needed to manage it."
