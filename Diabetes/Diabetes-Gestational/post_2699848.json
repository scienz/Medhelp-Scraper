The cutoff was 140 and my number came back as 170. \n\nI do not like or eat anything that is sweet. :( my only weakness is rice but that too i had limited the intake. I lost 1.5 lbs between 24 to 28 weeks. And diabetes does not run in our family at all. Still the numbers came back so high. I have my 3 hrs test scheduled on wednesday. Not that m freaking out but just a little disheartened. I honeslty thought i would pass this 1 hr test. Not sure what i ate/did wrong.\n\nAny experience sharing or suggestions would ve very very helpful to ease my mind."

But will accept whatever happens and do my best! Thats all i can control. :)\n\n@azndoraemon: i am not sure. But you could have a point. My husband's family does have a history of high blood sugar!! I will defintely ask my doc during the next visit if that could make a difference. Also i have heard from a doctor friend of mine that stress can produce hormones which increase the blood sugar level. I was indeed very very stressed the last 2 weeks(thanks to my MIL!!). So that could be the reason too. Ugghh!!"

But in order to know we would have to examine what u eat on a regular bases for a while. N ur fat percentage n body type. If it's not that it's just pregnancy developed diabetes.. it might go away but it does mean that ur more likely to develop it later on in life.

Initially was a little upset since i was not expecting this result going by my family history and my food habbits. But now i feel its better that i will be closely monitored and get all the special care rather than doing something wrong and going undetected! Anything thats good for my baby, i wouldnt mind doing. :)\n\nAnother positive outcome from my GD diagnosis is that i have completely started ignorning my MIL and her tantrums, have learnt to say a \"NO\" and set the limits without hesitating. All i really care is about my baby! Just want theae remaining 10 weeks to pass away soooon! :)"
