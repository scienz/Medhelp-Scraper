I couldn't tolerate the glucose and vomited within a half hour and I really tried so hard to keep it down! Because of that, I now have to take my blood sugar 4 times a day, which is understandable. Unfortunately, most readings are well below 100... On top of already being anemic, I'm wondering if low sugar levels are also contributing to my dizziness and fatigue."
