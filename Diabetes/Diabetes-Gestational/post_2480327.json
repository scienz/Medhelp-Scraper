My mum has rang my GP surgery this morning for info and they have told her that i can't have a cigarette after 10pm tonight until I have had my 2nd blood test... is this right? No hate please about smoking in pregnancy I just want advice because surely a cigarette has nothing to do with my sugar tolerance..."

Take your glucose drink exactly one hour from being tested make she you tell the the time you finished drinking. Smoking shouldnt be a problem. I do somtimes and did. And I past with flying colors ! Your score shouldn't be over 135 140 mine was in the low 100s. Good luck"
