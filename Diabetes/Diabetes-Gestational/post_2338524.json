But if you have actual diabetes in your family you run a higher risk yes. Also if you are considered iver weight you are high risk. I have it currently. 29 wks along. Doc told me as long as i make sure my blood sugar stays under norm numbers. It will go away after birth. It also means baby will possibly be born with low blood sugar due to it. And ve fed sugar water to get sugars to norm levels. Your baby will be fine. But you should get sugars under control and let this be a lesson."

For instance if you have a family member with it or they had gestational diabetes it does increase your risk. As does poor diet and obesity. Know all the facts before you feel the need to be insulting. We're all here to learn from each other. Not tear each other down."
