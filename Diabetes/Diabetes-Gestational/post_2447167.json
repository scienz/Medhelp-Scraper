My blood pressure has been a little high. And my doc says she doesn't think I have it. But she said because of being a little over weight and having a little high blood pressure. If I don't go into labor and don't have my daughter by 37 weeks without having to be induced that by my 38th week she will induce me. I'm kind of excited because I wanna meet my daughter but I'm also scared. I'm scared that because your due date is just an estimation what if that estimation is wrong and in sad ready of being 38 weeks I was actually 34 weeks. I just don't wanna see my daughter have to go to the nicu. But I know if it does happen we have good docs that will take good care of her. I'm also scared because they say being induced makes labor harder and hurt way more. That it's gonna put me into stress and stress out my daughter where they will have to do a c section.and it doesn't help that ive never had surgery before I'm I am afraid to be cut open. But I have family and friends that wI'll be here for me. And it also doesn't help when y husband says idk if I can be on the room while you're getting cut open. Idk if I can handle seeing them do that. And it's like okay what if it's really late and nobody answers there phones to come down. Or anything and I end up no having anybody there to keep me calm. I'm gonna feel like I'm alone and I'm going to flip out. And he goes okay if nobody is @ the hospital that you would like to be in there with you. Then I will go. But if I get to push and do it natural. I'm gonna have my best friend and my husband by my side holding my hands."

Induction is out of the question due to the previous scarring and will prolong the labour please read the section about Vbac... There is a new guideline coming in 2015 and the concerns of midwives pushing for vbac. Hope this helps you"
