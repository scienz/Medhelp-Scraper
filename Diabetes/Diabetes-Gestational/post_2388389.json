She was really upset when she had to use the insulin. But her dr explained it wasn't a reflection on her or necessarily her diet, it was just the strain the pregnancy put on her body."

I had GD with my second pregnancy. Just make sure you eat healthy and check your sugar levels. As long as you have that taken care of you should be fine"
