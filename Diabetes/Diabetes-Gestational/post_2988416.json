I just failed the first hour so I had to do the 2 hour. I got the call saying 2 out of 3 tests were normal. The middle one wasn't. How many of you failed the second test but your doctor still didn't have much concern since only 1 out of 3 came back high. He told me to see a dietitian next week but me to keep eating how I'm eating. He never said anything about medication at all though. Did anyone of you have to go in medication at all or just check your blood"

The other 2 were normal so I think he really like you said what to eat and what not to. I cut down on a lot of junk and basically having water only. I know fruit has natural sugar but I like fruit so that I would have to cut back on especially bananas since they are high in sugar and eat more veggies"
