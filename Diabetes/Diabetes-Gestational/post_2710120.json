With my first I ate all day and failed the hour and then passed the 3 hour and so with my second baby I decided to just not eat before the first one because I hated the 3 hour one lol I was starving!!!!! Does your family have a history of it in the women when they were pregnant?"

It will be important to go through with the 3 hour test, or even better, to get a blood sugar meter and start testing fasting and 2 hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0Then feed this information back to your doctor.\n\nCarbs are what causes your blood sugar to rise.\u00a0\u00a0So your are going to need to strictly control how much carbs and particularly sweets you eat. \n\nProtein and fat have much less impact on blooodd sugar than carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Green leafy veges are also pretty much free foods with minimal impact on blood sugar..\n\nIt is important to avoid natural sugars and artificial sweeteners, which are also not good for your body at all.\n\nLet us know how you go wih additional testing / monitoring."
