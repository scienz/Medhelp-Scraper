      "POST_BODY": "Just got back my GTT results and was found to have an abnormal result. At fasting, my levels were 5.0 and after 2hrs it was 8.2 (normal level is 7.8). I've now been referred to the diabetes team for educational classes. Just wondering whether these readings are valid considering everyone responds differently to sugary drinks? I don't ever drink lucozade, nor so much sugary drinks so just a bit confused. I follow a relatively healthy diet and these results are just a bit upsetting. \n\nIn most situations, we don't ingest so much glucose at one time, do we? Does anyone understand the logic behind this test?\n\nAlso, lucozade isn't really a medical product, is it? I mean, its a manufactured product containing the following:\n\"Carbonated Water, Glucose Syrup (25%), Citric Acid (E330), Lactic Acid (E270), Flavouring (unspecified), Preservatives (Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulphite (E-222)), Caffeine, Antioxidant (Ascorbic Acid), Colour (Sunset Yellow (E110), Ponceau 4R). A warning is printed on packaging that the colourings may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\" \nSo I'm highly suspicious about the effects of this drink on blood sugar levels.\n\nMy question is, those who got an abnormal reading, with dietary changes, did you have a reverse in the results and was your baby affected? Is the result I got worth having sleepless nights over?"
