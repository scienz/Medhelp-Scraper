They can be big but their lungs are not as developed.\n\nit will really depend on your doctor if they want to induce early.\u00a0\u00a0However, it is generally not considered wise to induce before 38 weeks unless there is a clear medical reason.. \n\nThe best thing I could recommend for the next 2 weeks is make sure you have excellent blood sugar control to avoid baby growing excessively from your extra sugar."

My doctor hasn't mentioned inducing yet so maybe she'll encourage 40 weeks. I was about 8 pounds when born but my husband is a twin and he was born premature at 5 pounds. So genetically I wouldn't think this baby would be large."
