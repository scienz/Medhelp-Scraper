She didn't really give me insight as to when. I'm assuming after meals. But how long do I wait after I eat to test? One hour or 2? And when should start counting the hour from? The start of when I eat or after I finish eating?"

I would suggest that you write down what did you eat at every meal so it will gives you insight into what type of food could be good or bad for you."
