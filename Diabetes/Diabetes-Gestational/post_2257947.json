      "POST_BODY": "So I went to see the specialist today and let me say first off I was devastated when I found out I had it last week Wednesday ftm @33wks bc it doesn't run in my family and I never had it before. But listening and talking to the specialist it's not that bad and my scoring wasn't bad at all either just by a couple points but I realize that if you just go by the diet and that the things they give you that everything will be ok. But I didn't realize that having high sugars can literally make the babies heart stop at no matter what week you are she's seen it at happen to a lady at 38wks :( that hurt my heart. Bc I don't understand how mothers to be can't follow and do what they have to do for the time being of your pregnancy in order for you\u00a0\u00a0and your child to remain healthy . But I pray daily so I have confidence . Everything will be ok ! \rPositive thoughts, Positive results !!!! :)"
