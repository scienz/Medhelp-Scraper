      "POST_BODY": "i have been measuring my blood sugar levels recently and it seems that mainly my problem is my fasting count -usually between 96 and 112. due to my pregnancy i am a bit more antsy about it and have begun measuring my blood sugar more often and at times at which i havent been specifically told to do so. for example now, 3/4 hours after last eating it is 133. am i right to worry? should i be taking insulin?\nthanks in advance."
