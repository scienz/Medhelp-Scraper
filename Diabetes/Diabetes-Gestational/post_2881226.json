      "POST_BODY": "Just found out after I passed my three hour test 4 weeks ago, that I am GD. I spike mostly after breakfast each morning. What do you ladies eat in the morning? My fasting check has been good before I eat but breakfast screws it up. Lunch and dinner isn't bad as long as I'm eating more protein. Supposed to take a medication morning and night and test 7 times a day. It's frustrating but, any tips on breakfast ideas? I do not like the taste of cheese so that has to be ruled out."

Oatmeal works, too. The dietitian basically said to stick to two servings of carbs for breakfast (30g)."
