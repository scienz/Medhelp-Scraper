First week they tried just diet/exercise, 2nd week gave me pills, 3rd week upped the dosage, now they are saying up dosage again and start insulin.\u00a0\u00a0My numbers haven't changed, they are 85-95 fasting, under 120 for lunch and all over the place for dinner but no higher than 150.\u00a0\u00a0The results have been the same no matter the dose so far. This is my fifth pregnancy and I had gd with my third too, completely controlled with diet/exercise. This is a different dr this time and I'm worried that they are going extreme fast with no benefit. Is this normal progression?"
