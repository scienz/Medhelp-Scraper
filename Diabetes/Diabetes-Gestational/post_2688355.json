IF it is not, ie. higher (lower is ok), then you need to reduce the carbs eaten - replace with protein, fats, or different carb that has less impact.\n\nVeges are good for you so make an effort to eat these.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid sweets, cola, juices, limit fruits, small portion only of bread, rice, pasta etc."
