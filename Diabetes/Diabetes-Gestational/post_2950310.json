I've learned some prenatals already contain it, others do not, and my prenatal doesn't. I've read for type 2 diabetics many have had success lowering their blood sugar with chromium too."

              "RESPONSE_BODY": "Hi, \n\nYes, some people find some benefit in adding chromium to help with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 You can only try it to know.\u00a0\u00a0Please be sure to following dosing instructions if ever you try it and let your Ob-gyne know you are using it, in case he or she has any concerns. \n\nGenerally supplements give minimal benefit to blood sugar management, though they may help some, particularly if there was a deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0The proven ways however include:-\n\n1. Eating lower carb diet and particularly avoiding added sugars and sweetened foods (this is safe during pregnancy - your baby needs your blood sugar to be normal).\n\n2. Exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Walking or other exercise will be very beneficial. \n\n3. Taking medications if and when\u00a0\u00a0your diet and exercise are not enough to manage blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0 Usually in diabetic pregnancy, the medication of choice will be insulin. \n\nYou should also have and use a blood sugar meter to tell you if your sugars are on target and also to guide you in your foods selection (ie. to see which foods raise your sugars and which do not).\u00a0\u00a0Typically fat has no impact on blood sugar (should be natural and unprocessed), protein has moderate and slow effect on blood sugar (if the diabetes is mild may not have any obvious effect), carbohydrates have large effect on blood sugar. \n\nHOpe this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes for a smooth and healthy pregnancy."

I haven't had much trouble keeping my numbers low and steady as long as I follow my diet, however I'm starving. I'm always hungry. And with my diet I can't eat enough to satisfy my hunger. It's absolutely terrible. That's why I read up on supplementing with chromium, thinking pregnancy brought on a deficiency in me, since I don't have any family diabetes, have always been on the smaller side and healthy, and I'm only 24 and caucasian, which are considered low-risk groups for gestational diabetes. Anywho. Never been so hungry in my life. Want to eat but don't want to raise my blood sugars too much to harm baby :)"
