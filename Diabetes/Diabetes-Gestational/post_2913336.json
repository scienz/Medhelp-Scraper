      "POST_BODY": "So, here in the UK we have a mini glucose tolerance test at 28 weeks. If you have raised blood sugar levels you then have to take the full version of the test. \n\nWith my first baby I passed the mini GTT with flying colours! This time round I've been scheduled in for the full version of the test.\n\nI know they'll give me lots more information at the next appointment but in the meantime, has anyone gone through this? What are the dangers of having GD?! Can this effect the baby? \n\nThanks x"
