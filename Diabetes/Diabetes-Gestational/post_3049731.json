If your stomach lining is irritated, you can have elevated lipase.\u00a0\u00a0https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322201.php\u00a0\u00a0You could also have your symptoms and pancreatitis and have elevated lipase.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes a bland diet will help such as the brat diet.\u00a0\u00a0This is banana, rice, applesauce, and toast. Lipase can stay elevated for a couple of weeks after a bout of gastroenteritis or pancreatitis. How long has it been?"
