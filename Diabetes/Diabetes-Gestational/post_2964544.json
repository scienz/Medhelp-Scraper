I followed the no fruit/dairy at breakfast and dinner snack recommendation, as well.\u00a0\u00a0What else can I do to lower these numbers?"

I am still lower in carbs than my dietician wants, but it is working for me and I get plenty of nutrients, so I am slightly shucking her recommendation. She wants me to get between 175-200g of carbs a day, but I find keeping it between 150-170 works best for me. I'm going to keep this up to see if I can make it to the end without meds/insulin."
