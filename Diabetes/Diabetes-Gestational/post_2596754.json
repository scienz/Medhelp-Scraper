If the hormonal changes in your body have affected your natural insulin production to the point that diet restrictions aren't enough, you will need to start a medication regimen - an oral medication will be the first step, with insulin injections used only if all previous interventions have failed."

If you are sticking with your diet and still having high sugars, you need to contact your doctor for the next step, which could be medication. \n\nI understand your hesitation. I also think many medical problems these days can be solved by lifestyle and diet changes. I had gd with my last pregnancy that was well-managed with diet, so this pregnancy I was disappointed and thought I was doing something wrong even though I was eating almost no carbs and having high sugars. Once I went to insulin (after a brief time on oral meds), I feel great, can eat more normally, and baby is still growing at a good rate. I was able to relax much more and not stress about my baby's health.\n\nTake advantage of your nutritionist's and doctor's advice and keep in contact with them often until you feel at ease with your routine. GD is not a big problem if you keep it under control.\n\nGood luck!!"
