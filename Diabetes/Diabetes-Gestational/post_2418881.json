I have been checking my sugars since about 12 weeks 4 times a day and am now 27 weeks and haven't gained weight due to altering my eating habits. They gave me my glucose test sooner just to be sure and it came back positive. As long as you take care of yourself and eat healthy you should be ok if you come back positive for your test. I ended up on insulin with my firstborn and don't want to do that again. Good luck!"
