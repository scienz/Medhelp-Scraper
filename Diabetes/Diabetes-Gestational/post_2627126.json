Everyone says the orange is the best one but one of my girlfriends went last week and said the orange was awful and not to get it. Did anyone try a different flavor besides orange and is the drink a thick texture??"

They give you 5 minutes to drink it, which is a lot of time. Even doing the small sips I finished in about 2.5-3 minutes. My friend chugged it and then after 20 minutes she barfed and had to do it again."
